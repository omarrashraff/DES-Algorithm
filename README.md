# DES-Algorithm
This repository contains a complete implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, a symmetric-key block cipher that was once the federal standard for data encryption in the United States. The implementation provides both encryption and decryption functionalities using the classic 64-bit DES algorithm with 56-bit keys.
